Used ProtonVPN to test encrypted tunnelling, verify IP change, and understand VPN benefits (privacy, security) and limitation

🛡️ VPN Practical
🔍 Objective
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and ensuring secure communication.

🧰 Tools Used
ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
whatismyipaddress.com for IP verification
fast.com for speed test
ipleak.net for DNS leak check
⚙️ Steps Performed
Installed and set up ProtonVPN on Windows 11.
Connected to a free server (Netherlands).
Verified changed IP using whatismyipaddress.com.
Confirmed encryption and no DNS leaks on ipleak.net.
Checked browsing speed before and after VPN connection.
Disconnected VPN and compared results.
🔐 VPN Encryption & Privacy Features
ProtonVPN uses AES-256-bit encryption and protocols like OpenVPN and WireGuard for secure data tunneling. It offers DNS leak protection and a Kill Switch to maintain privacy and prevent IP exposure.

📊 Observations
IP changed successfully after connection.
Connection was encrypted and stable.
Slight reduction in speed due to encryption overhead.
📄 Summary
Benefits: Hides IP, encrypts traffic, secures Wi-Fi, prevents tracking, and bypasses restrictions.
Limitations: Slight speed drop, limited free servers, not fully anonymous, some sites block VPNs.
